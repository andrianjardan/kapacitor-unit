# Kapacitor-unit

**A test framework for TICKscripts**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DreadPirateShawn/kapacitor-unit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DreadPirateShawn/kapacitor-unit) ![Release Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-0.8-blue.svg)


Kapacitor-unit is a testing framework to make TICK scripts testing easy and
automated. Testing with Kapacitor-unit is as easy as defining the test configuration saying which alerts are expected to trigger when the TICK script processes specific data.

## Features

:heavy_check_mark: Run tests for **stream** TICK scripts using protocol line data input 

:heavy_check_mark: Run tests for **batch** TICK scripts using protocol line data input 

:soon: Run tests for **stream** and **batch** TICK scripts using recordings 


## Requirements

To run tests, both Kapacitor and Influx need to be running. (The latter is used for batch queries.)

These can be started using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/):
```
make start-kapacitor-and-influx
```

In order for all features to be supported, the Kapacitor version running the tests must be v1.3.4 or higher.

## Installing kapacitor-unit

**Binary from upstream:**
```
 $ curl -L https://github.com/DreadPirateShawn/kapacitor-unit/raw/master/main -o /usr/local/bin/kapacitor-unit
 $ chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/kapacitor-unit
```

**Building from source:**
```
 $ go install ./cmd/kapacitor-unit
 $ kapacitor-unit
```

**Building a docker container:**
```
$ docker build -t kapacitor-unit .
```

**Running from source without rebuilding:**
```
 $ go run ./cmd/kapacitor-unit/main.go
```

Note that the Makefile uses a docker container to support testing / development
without locally installing golang.

## Running tests

```
kapacitor-unit --dir <*.tick directory> --kapacitor <kapacitor host> --influxdb <influxdb host> --tests <test configuration path>
```

### Test case definition:

```yaml

# Test case for alert_weather.tick
tests:
  
   # This is the configuration for a test case. The 'name' must be unique in the
   # same test configuration. 'description' is optional

  - name: Alert weather:: warning
    description: Task should trigger Warning when temperature raises about 80 

    # 'task_name' defines the name of the file of the tick script to be loaded
    # when running the test
    task_name: alert_weather.tick

    db: weather
    rp: default 
    type: stream

     # 'data' is an array of data in the line protocol
    data:
      - weather,location=us-midwest temperature=75
      - weather,location=us-midwest temperature=82

    # Alert that should be triggered by Kapacitor when test data is running 
    # against the task
    expects:
      ok: 0
      warn: 1
      crit: 0


  - name: Alert no. 2 using recording
    task_id: alert_weather.tick
    db: weather
    rp: default 
    type: stream
    recordind_id: 7c581a06-769d-45cb-97fe-a3c4d7ba061a
    expects:
      ok: 0
      warn: 1
      crit: 0


  - name: Alert no. 3 - Batch
    task_id: alert_weather.tick
    db: weather
    rp: default 
    duration: 30m
    type: batch
    data:
      - weather,location=us-midwest temperature=80 now()-1m
      - weather,location=us-midwest temperature=82 now()
    expects:
      ok: 0
      warn: 1
      crit: 0

```  

Note that `now() - 30m + 1m` relative influx timestamps can be used in batch data;
the only usage requirement is that `now()` needs to start the dynamic timestamp.
This currently only supports hours `h`, minute `m`, and seconds `s`.

### Pushing the container image to a container registry
By default it pushes the latest tag to **andrianjardana1/kapacitor-unit:latest** when 
you run:
```
$ make push_to_registry
```
but it can be adjusted by running:
```
$ make push_to_registry TAG=<YOUR_TAG> PLATFORMS=<comma,separated,list,of,platforms>
```

### Debugging

Note that `log()` nodes added to tick script will appear in the kapacitor logs.
When running samples in this project, see [kapacitor config](infra/kapacitor/kapacitor.conf)
to determine whether that's a log file or STDERR, noting that the former (file)
will exist inside the target running kapacitor container.
